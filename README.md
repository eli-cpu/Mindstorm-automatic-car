# Mindstorm-automatic-car
self driving lego mindstorm car, finding a way from A to B

this project was made as a school project and it wasn't finished up to the deadline.
The code should let the car drive from point A to F, but it is extremly slow due to the use of lejos, to bring java on the Ev3 Brick.
Also it can't follow a black line and turns in the wrong way. 
It takes a lot of time, until the colorsensor realises, it's on a green point and the lineleader takes a lot of time, until it realises, it's away from the line, even though it's a lot quicker in testing.
Overall it has a lot of software problems and I would recommend using python on the brick, since it worked on it from another  group.
If someone finds this code, he can finish it and i don't claim any rights on it. It's free to use to all people. I wish, that the lejos developer can get attention to this post, since lejos is actually a great idea, but not made good. 

# Installation of Lejos
The installation process was quite hard and took at least a month, to finsih.

You need an Ev3 Brick, an Micro SD card with 8gb or less (not more, since from 16gb or more it doesn't work), a micro usb cable, a pc (I used windows here, I guess linux works just like this, but i don't know about macs)

First of you need an oracle account with even a adress and etc.
Then you go on this website https://sourceforge.net/projects/ev3.lejos.p/files/ and get lejos and install it onto you pc.
After that you install eclipse and set it up for lejos.
You also need a rdnis driver, which you can get by simply searching for it.
You're going to eclipse marketplace (yes, you need another thing) and search for the lejos ev3 extension.
After you installed the extension and start eclipse, you see a header in eclipse called lejos ev3. You hit that header and than "start ev3sdcard control" 
There you go on "click the link [...]" and download the 7 60 version. Not version 8 !!!! since that one never worked on my brick. There you login with the oracle account and
